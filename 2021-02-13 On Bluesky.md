Web3: “user-generated authority, enabled by self-certifying web protocols.” A superset of technologies that include blockchains, but are not limited to them. 

Or we can just use “Self-Certifying Web Protocols” (SCWP).

****

It's noteworthy to me that much of the conversation around cryptospace is happening mainly through the use of two tools: Discord and Twitter.

****

I'm not much of a fan of Discord and its ilk (Teams, Slack, etc.) for empowering large groups of people spread across the planet. I think they are severely lacking in asynchronous affordances. Email is ripe for a return to centrality, but that's a topic for another day.

****

Twitter, on the other hand, is a tool extremely suited to the task. I believe it will continue as a (if not _the_) ideal communications tool for our age because it's asyncronous, concise, and available.

****

Twitter's ability to become the default social network runs aground on two fronts: Twitter the media business, and bad-faith user behavior.

Each of these are places where there's difficult-but-tractable work to be done. Work that can make the notion of cryptospace appealing, particularly to people who have no interest in collectible JPEGs or digital gold.

****

And, thankfully, the person leading this work, @arcalinea, has the most evolved and mature perspective on how to proceed.

****

Late last year, Graeber wrote "Web3 is Self-Certifying", in which they assert that cryptospace is enabled by two main ingredients:

1. Cryptographic user keys
2. Content-addressed data

****

The former establishes user-generated identity, and when paired with the latter, creates, "user-generated authority."

You can trust -- thanks to cryptography -- a user identity, and that that identity authorized the creation of a piece of data.

****

As Graber rightly points out, this architecture already in use today, with Git being arguably the most successful example: A signed commit is a self-certified piece of data.

****

From this point of view the value of a blockchain becomes more clear. It is not a requirement in order for user-generated authority to exist. Rather, the technology simply allows for global consensus on the record of all the data in the system.

****

By conceiving of user-generated authority as a superset of blockchains, complex applications too complex for today's blockchain implementations become plausible.

Enter @bluesky.

****

If each piece of data authored in a global public conversation is self-certifying, then it's no longer necessary for a blockchain to reconcile the state of that conversation in real time.

****

What becomes more important in the near term, as opposed to debating the technical feasibility of 'building a social network on a blockchain' are the user experience elements of that future application.

****

Elements like:

- Who am I?
- What is my reputation?
- How do others interact with what I add to the conversation?
- How is my participation discovered or moderated?

****

These are far more interesting and approachable issues to be working on. 'Computers that make commitments' as @cdixon calls blockchains, may one day reach price-to-performance ratios we all deem acceptable.

****

Today, we have the necessary pieces to build a protocol which can exist apart from Twitter the media company, and one which makes undesirable user behavior a challenge to be taken on by anyone.

****

We can build a medium for global public conversation in which any entity, from a for-profit corporation to a single individual, can not only interoperate but innovate.

****

This thesis -- Self-Certifying Web Protocols are the way forward --  strikes me as directionally correct.

It's also the most pragmatic conceptual framework I've seen in cryptospace thus far.

Count me in.
