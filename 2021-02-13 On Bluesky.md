> In short, these three stages are “the hosted web, the posted web, and the signed web.” -- @jaygraber | https://jaygraber.medium.com/web3-is-self-certifying-9dad77fd8d81

****

It's telling to me that much of the conversation around cryptospace is happening mainly through the use of two tools: Discord and Twitter.

****

I'm not much of a fan of Discord-like tools (Teams, Slack, etc.) as the means for empowering large groups of people spread across the planet. I think email is ripe for a return to centrality, but that's a topic for another day.

****

Twitter, on the other hand, is a tool perfectly suited to continue as a (if not _the_) ideal communications tool for our age: It's asyncronous, concise, and highly available.

****

The place I think people get stuck is two things: Twitter the business, and bad-faith user behavior.

Each of these are places where there's meaningful work being done in improve the experience of global public conversation.

****

And that global public conversation is an ideal use case for what @JayGraeber calls the signed web.

****

Late last year Graeber wrote "Web3 is Self-Certifying", in which they assert that much of what cryptospace contains is enabled by two main ingredients:

1. Cryptographic user keys
2. Content-addressed data

****

The former establishes user-generated identity, and when paired with the latter, creates, "user-generated authority."

You can trust -- thanks to cryptography -- a user identity, and that that identity authorized the creation of a piece of data.

****

As Graber rightly points out, there are examples of this architecture in use today. Git is arguably the most successful example; a signed commit is a self-certified piece of data.

****

From this point of view, the value of a blockchain becomes more clear. The technology simply allows for global consensus on the behavior of all the identities in the system.

****

By conceiving of user-generated authority as a superset of blockchains, more complex applications can become plausible: Enter @bluesky.

****

If each piece of data authored in a global public conversation is self-certifying, then it's no longer necessary for a blockchain to reconcile the full state of that conversation in real time.

****

What becomes more important then, rather than quibbling about the technical feasibility of 'building a social network on a blockchain' are the user experience elements of that future application elements like:

- Who am I?
- What is my reputation?
- How do others find me?
- How am I discovered or moderated?

****

This thesis strikes me as directionally correct, and the conceptual framework the most pragmatic I've seen in cryptospace thus far. Count me in.
