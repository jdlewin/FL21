The thing about rabbit holes is that they change you.

There is a common refrain amongst those who have given themselves over to the blockchain era. It comes in a handful of different forms but it's always fundamentally the core concept: this is foundational work.

There are a tremendous number of people who have benefited from the current incarnations of our collective past. It's no surprise that many of them are riled up. We're nearing a flat point in the technological S-Curve, paired with significant cultural upheval.

Since I last wrote, I've discovered blockchain photographers.

People are sharing their work with authenticity. They are taking a particular care in expressing their work with an air of self-respect. Like they believe with every fiber of their being that each piece is of value. Simply by dint of their belief in themselves.

In other words, it feels a lot like Flickr did.

One of the cheaper shots from the anti-blockchain vernacular is, "I can just right click and steal your art."

Yes. You can today. And we should take a moment to acknowledge that. A great many of the advancements we have as a society can indeed be credited to the ability for code, media, or frankly any other form of human expression, from being repurposed.

The ability to do this is built into the system. It's unlikely do go away any time soon; as I overheard in Silicon Valley in the early 2000s, "music has to be analog for you to hear it." The means of copying any form of human expression is built into the species. We couldn't get rid of it if we tried.

So here's to everyone who has utilized this innate quality of conciousness -- don't ever stop ripping things off if it's what you feel you must do.

What is different now is that we can program our machines to support our better angels.

The person who dedicates their energy and time to producing a particular image feels a relationship to that image. As much as it is there to represent its subject, the image's existence is also there to reflect its author. And there are plenty of authors who don't care if they're credited for their work.

There are, however, plenty who would prefer credit. They would prefer recognition for what they've produced, whether that be based on the effort required to produce it, what the finished work means to them, or any other number of reasons. But those are their reasons. And for the first time, it would appear as though we may be able to programatically respect those wishes online.

This is what I mean by foundational.

Imagine a world where every interaction you have with piece media in cyberspace enabled whoever created it to recieve some form of recognition.

Pretty wild, isn't it?

Can you think of what that would do to our cultures? For all of us to have a shared understanding of the provenance of what we experience?

For the author to be able to hang their shingle out in cyberspace and know that, across all of the systems where their work might travel, the most basic signal would make it back to them. That their chosen title and commentary, in addition to the work itself, would be presented alongside. Or that they might exert some agency over when and how the work is shown at all.

It's an opportune moment to mention my annual appointment with U2.

Every year on DAYT_TK I listen to a mixing desk bootleg of the band's Dublin performance. I do this because I read an especially wonderful essay about all that was special about this moment in the band's history. The author helped me to better apperciate something that was already quite special to me.

The proverbial three kids in a garage who will become the next U2 have an entirely different set of capabilities than those Irish lads did. The kids today have low-latency networks and enough post-production capability in their pockets to produce adequate recordings effectively anywhere on Earth. The also have been building relationships in cyberspace for as long as they can remember.

Do we honestly expect them to submit to the idea that the only successful outcome involves becoming 'the biggest band in the world'? How could we ever expect them to feel obliged to follow the model set by people older than their parents? Why should we expect them to?

I expect them to do better than we could.

****

I expect them to see that it's possible to start from a mental model that says their work has worth. And that there's a cohort of people who envision a future for our existence which equips them to maintain a greater degree of agency with regard to what they create.

Not an abosolute degree of course, but enough that they are encouraged to continue creating. Enough that they have confidence to put their best foot forward; to be humble and honest about the how, what, and why of their craft; and to be interested in growing in their chosen form of expression.
