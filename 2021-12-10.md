"Computers that make commitments."

That's the key phrase. Uttered by Chris Dixon on the Bankless podcast. When I heard him explain blockchains this way back in January -- that was when my journey began.

****

The second was in December, when I read [Charlie Warzel's conversation with Aaron Lammer](https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/galaxy-brain/619717362e822d00205ab3e9/case-for-crypto/). Lammer did an exceptional job of pointing out a fundamental truism: blockchain today is as strange as the internet itself was to the average bear in the 80s and 90s.

****

So naturally when @FoldableHuman's Line Goes Up essay (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g) came across my radar, I gave it my full attention. Olson has produced something that anyone even remotely interested in these ideas should give time to.

****

As the title implies, Olson is also far closer to the "useful for enabling new forms of horrific behavior" edge of the spectrum than the "mechanism for technological nirvana" opposite one can very easily find today.

[^My writing here is in part an exercise in finding out.]

****

Broadly speaking though, I'm optimistic. Because we've taught computers to do something they couldn't do before.

How long it will take to get from this place to somewhere useful is unknown.

****

It will take some time before things stop looking like Bill trying to replace Dave's radio (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gipL_CEw-fk). But a fundamental aspect of computing has changed, and I believe it represents a change to the ecology of cyberspace. And when an ecology changes, shit gets wild.

****

The smartphone was the last time we saw ecological change like this. Those devices have become the dominant computing tool, and the changes have proven to be both broad and deep.

And not only that, like with ecologies in the traditional sense, change begets more change.

****

The changes to how people create and express their identities online are, for example, fascinating.

[^Why people selling each other JPEGs has proven to be the most popular application of identity is a topic for another time.]

****

As an outsized aspect of my identity is to share my thinking in writing, @viamirror has been of recent interest.

An early contender for the Blogspot prize, the crew at Mirror are building self-publishing tools on top of Ethereum.

****

Blogspot was the wild new thing when I was repairing iMacs at the Stanford Mall in 2005. The most successful writers of the day, blessed by publishing houses and media outlets, and showed very little interest in such a toy.

****

But the people of that era who embraced the toy and explored what it could do, produced ideas of substance, created names for themselves, and in some cases, built tools which have stood the test of time.

****

What happens when

****

That publishing essays like this one can produce new shapes is only one aspect of this one star system. There are other forms of creative expression to explore: musicians and poets and visual artists. There are ideas around state and organizational identity. And around careers and skills development. And pseyduonyimty. And more still beyond me at this moment.

****

To really internalize this dynamic, I find thinking about ecologies like galaxy metaphor feels appropriate: There are numerous star systems to explore, only some of which we're aware of thus far. Who knows how many planets each system consists of, and what each of those contains?
