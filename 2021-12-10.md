"Computers that make commitments."

That's the key phrase. Uttered by Chris Dixon on the Bankless podcast. When I heard him explain blockchains this way back in January -- that was when my journey began.

An equally powerful moment came this past week, when I read [Charlie Warzel's conversation with Aaron Lammer](https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/galaxy-brain/619717362e822d00205ab3e9/case-for-crypto/). Lammer did an exceptional job of pointing out a fundamental truism: blockchain today is as strange as the internet itself was to the average bear in the 80s and 90s.

In 1995, [Bill Gates attempted to explain the internet to David Letterman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gipL_CEw-fk). Why listen to a baseball broadcast on a computer when radios exist, chided Dave. How could anyone come to the conclusion that a small household appliance, costing TK_COST in today's dollars, was a reasonable choice when radios were built into every car and in every home already?

Adam McCay, filmmaker and the father of Pearl the toddler landlord, named his production company Hyperoject. The term is used to describe, say, a paper coffee cup, but rather all paper coffee cups throughout time. [^Still think travel cups are too much of a hassle?] One of the thought technologies I've found to be quite helpful in understanding blockchain era is that any every chain is a hyperobject. Without all the combined computation there is no experience; the collected action of all a chain's users is what alows it to exist. The activity is the computer. [^Scott McNeely strikes again!]

Which brings us to how, I believe, most blockchain applications, like BTC or ETH, have been painted with the bad-for-the-planet brush. In order for those computers to compute, a significant amount of electricity is consumed. That we are living through a moment of reckoning as a species in terms of how we produce electricity the effect that has on this planet is no laughing matter. And so the advent of what appears to be an superfulous daliance in cyberspace does create something of an easy target for criticism. I'm not going to ignore this aspect of things; I'm simply setting it aside for the moment.

Another idea worth setting aside is the instantiating application of blockchain technology. While some would argue that the Bitcoin white paper is this century's Magna Carta, it is naive to dismiss such an argument because one doesn't believe the world needs a different store of value or medium of exchange. Leave out that the desire to transact without the involvement of a third party is older than the goddamned British Empire. No, it's enough to point out that everything being built today; everything you've heard about; all of it is no more than $TK_YEARS_SINCE_SATOSHI years old.

It will take some time before things stop looking like Bill trying to replace Dave's radio.

The inarguable truth is that a fundamental aspect of computing has changed: Digital scarcity exists. This represents a change to the ecology of cyberspace. And when an ecology changes, shit gets weird.

The smartphone was the last time computing changed to this degree. Computing became predominantly mobile, and the changes have been broad, deep, and long. In that era as in this one, the galaxy metaphor feels appropriate. There are numerous star systems to explore, only some of which we're aware of thus far. Who knows how many planets each system consists of, and what each of those contains?

One of these areas of interest for me is how blockchains will alter identity. The changes to how a user in cyberspace creates, exhibits, and maintains their identity are facinating. [^Another topic to explore is the culture critique around why people selling each other illustrated avatar JPEGs has proven to be the most popular application of identity. For now, it's enough to say that we are still, as a species, often driven by displays of wealth and status.] As my most direct application of identity is my desire to share my thinking, the crew at Mirror are of particular interest.

Coming out as an early contender for the Blogger prize[^Ask your parents], the Mirror tools allow anyone to connect to the means of commercializing the written word.

What the Mirror crew is building is precisely what spoke to me as a blogger when I was disassembling iMacs on University Avenue. The most successful imprints of that era produced writing which has moved me deeply. And yet that relationship, developed between me the a reader and those I read, isn't available with a chain of attribution, patronage, or distribution. Building an audience and a point-of-view today can offer a tangible value in and of itself [^Again, a philosophical question another time.]

That publishing essays like this one can produce new shapes is only one aspect of this one star system. There are other forms of creative expression to explore: musicians and poets and visual artists. There are ideas around state and organizational identity. And around careers and skills development. And pseyduonyimty. And more still beyond me at this moment.

In adjacent systems are DAOs and DeFi. NFTs and Bitcoin. And dark money and plenty more things, exciting and concerning. All I can tell you is that it wouldn't be a new frontier if there weren't charlatans, storms, and dragons. To bury one's head in the sand, or discount anyone who hasn't already decided to do the same, is no way to live. Go find anyone over the age of sixty and ask them what the popular opinion of personal computing was in 1975. To have believed that we'd all be living as we do today would've had you labelled a heretic.[^A favorite dystopian example here is Gary Shtyngart's Super Sad True Love Story.]

Which is how I've arrived here with you, dear reader. My life's circumstances are such that I'm now more motivated to explore than to not. I haven't felt a stronger urge to bring my authentic self out to play in some time. There have been prior attempts to uncover my 'beat' as it were, but very little which has truly excited me; end of the S-curve and all that I suppose. While reaching the point where smartphones are replaced with glasses sounds exciting, it's the applications of blockchain technology which will enable the most interesting scenarios in that environment. For starters, what is fashion in a world where one's appearance is the product of software code as opposed to textiles?

Two of my favorite thinkers of the last century were Hunter Thompson and John Perry Barlow. They were each exceedingly, unabashedly, their own characters. My hope is that I can channel a bit of their energy as I explore the stars. Consider this essay the first in a collection. Dispatches from the field. Situation reports. Letters home.

If you're at all interested, I do hope you'll let me know.
