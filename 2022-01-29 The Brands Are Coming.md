The brands are coming for crypto. And that's a good sign. it's a sign that this particular wave is about to crash.

I don't mean that to say there won't be anything left, or that a wave crashing is like a tsunami. I'm not predicting carnage, though there most certainly will be. No. What I mean is that a bunch of productive and destructive things are around the corner...

- Gwynth Paltrow and Bieber join BAYC: if that doesn't signal a number of things
    - Media follows culture.
    - Huge awareness boost.
    - Huge loss of 'cool.'

- Discord is a weakness: the stories of hacks all involve social engineering, to say nothing of the core model as a syncronous service.
    - Does a DAO buy / build Discord?
    - Where are the middleware shops to help?
    - Twitter remains central.

- Bluesky and Mirror: the strong counterpoints to NFT energy.
    - Where Mirror succeeds medium by monetizing better.
    - Bluesky's future runs on the rails NFTs run on.
    - Crypto-publishing proves the naivete of right-click mentality.
