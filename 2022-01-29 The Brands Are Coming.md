## The Brands Are Coming
#### TK_DISPATCH_DATE

The brands are coming for crypto. And that's a good sign. it's a sign that this particular wave is about to crash.

****

I don't mean that to say there won't be anything left, or that a wave crashing is like a tsunami. I'm not predicting carnage, though there most certainly will be. No. What I mean is that a bunch of productive and destructive things are around the corner...

Gwynth Paltrow and Justin Bieber have joined the rarified air that is the Bored Ape Yacht Club. Bud Light is a member of the Nouns DAO. If that doesn't signal the beginning of the end for what people find fashionable, I don't know what is.

****

These facts point to a few things:

- That media and culture shape and influence one another more than is necessarily obvious.
- The surge in awareness brings people with an extremely wide variety of motivations.
- The mark of 'cool' becomes more difficult to maintain as awareness increases.

Having listened to the post-Mortem on the  Goodfellas project hack, it's clear that some hard lessons are being learned. Many of these lessons are around social engineering. The other apparent factor however Discord plays an unfortunately central role.

****

On the surface one would simply see this as an opportunity. I have no doubt a cadre of 'specialists' are coming together to offer the value-added service of properly designing and implementing mature security practices. Which of those groups to trust is another matter entirely.

****

The secondary question is what becomes of Discord as arguably _the_ tool for people organizing work in these spaces? Does Discord get usurped by a superior alternative (of which there aren't many to choose from)? Does Discord try to harness the energy and build to meet the market? Do project organizers learn from their elders embrace email (a man can dream)?

****

Whatever happens, in the near term at least one thing is true: Twitter remains central. The company's head of product marketing has been on this trip for months, and the company's recent rollout of NFT profile photos is the latest deployment from a product giant that's been awakened in the past twelve months.
