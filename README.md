Naming things is difficult for me.

In all the years I've been online, coming up with names for things is the most difficult part of publishing. This is what makes me long Twitter, and why I think email hasn't resurged in popularity, is the expectation to encapsulate the meaning and value behind a given piece of writing into a single sentence.

For the time being this name will have to be enough.
