## The Brands Are Coming
#### TK_DISPATCH_DATE

****

The brands are coming for Cryptospace. I think it's a good sign. A sign that this particular wave may be about to crash.

****

I don't mean that to say there won't be anything left, or that a crashing wave is always a tsunami. I'm not predicting carnage necessarily, though there most certainly will be.

No. What I mean is that a number of destructive, and therefore productive, events are on the horizon.

****

First is that Gwynth Paltrow and Justin Bieber have joined the rarified air of the Bored Ape Yacht Club. And Bud Light is bringing NFTs to the SuperBowl.

If these facts don't signal the beginning of the end for what something fashionable, I don't know what does.

****

These facts also underscore a few things:

- Media follows culture a lot more than it would have anyone believe.

- The mark of 'cool' becomes more difficult to maintain as awareness increases.

- The surge in awareness brings people with extremely wide-ranging motivations.

****

Second is that, having listened to a few project horror stories, it's clear that some hard lessons are being learned. Many of these lessons are around social engineering. And in some cases, Discord plays an unfortunately central role.

****

On the surface one might simply see this as an opportunity. I have no doubt people are already hawking the value-added service of properly designed and implemented mature security practices. Which of those groups to trust is another matter entirely.

****

The secondary question is: what is the fate of Discord as _the_ tool for people trying to do meaningful work? Is it usurped by a superior alternative? Do they build to meet the market? Do project organizers learn from their elders embrace email?

****

Whatever happens, in the near term clear: Twitter remains central.

The Spaces product has proved indispensable, in addition the durability of the core experience. And the rollout of NFT support in user profiles is inspired.

****

Last year something happened and Twitter remembered it can build things. It'll be facinating to watch how much they lean into being associated with projects like these.

****

Which brings me to the two projects I'm most interested in at the moment: Bluesky and Mirror.

****

The former is the working group tasked with bringing forth the open protocol on which Twitter can operate a into the future; free to pursue its particular business priorities and exercise some stronger curatorial inclinations.

****

You cannot publish to Mirror by virtue of simply having an email address; you must use an Ethereum address. And that same address is programatically addressable, and is able to send and receive the cryptocurrency.

****

And while authors on Mirror _must_ be able to deal in that currency, anyone with a web browser can read what that author publishes.

Which, to my eyes, is one of the best counterpoints to the right-click retort from the peanut gallery....

****

...Because of course the words are free. It is the extent to which they reach an audience that any appreciable value can exist. The key is to enable any and every member of that audience to offer something in exchange.

****

Both of these tools are enabled by the same new type of rails. And as with just about any novel medium, it is a magnet for charlatans, hucksters, rubes, and fools. And vocal critics of its efficacies and externalities, both short and long term.

****

But to dismiss it all? To dismiss the rails because of what's running on them, or who's building them, or how they work today, is to severely miss the point.
