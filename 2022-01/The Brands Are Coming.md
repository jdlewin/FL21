## The Brands Are Coming
#### TK_DISPATCH_DATE

****

The brands are coming for Cryptospace. I think it's a good sign. A sign that this particular wave may be about to crash.

****

I don't mean that to say there won't be anything left, or that a crashing wave is always a tsunami. I'm not predicting carnage necessarily, though there most certainly will be.

No. What I mean is that a number of destructive, and therefore productive, events are on the horizon.

****

First is that Gwynth Paltrow and Justin Bieber have joined the rarified air of the Bored Ape Yacht Club. And Bud Light is bringing NFTs to the SuperBowl.

If these facts don't signal the beginning of the end for what something fashionable, I don't know what does.

****

These facts also underscore a few things:

- Media follows culture a lot more than it would have anyone believe.

- The mark of 'cool' becomes more difficult to maintain as awareness increases.

- The surge in awareness brings people with extremely wide-ranging motivations.

****

Second is that, having listened to the post-Mortem on the Goodfellas project hack, it's clear that some hard lessons are being learned. Many of these lessons are around social engineering. The other apparent factor however Discord plays an unfortunately central role.

****

On the surface one would simply see this as an opportunity. I have no doubt a cadre of 'specialists' are coming together to offer the value-added service of properly designing and implementing mature security practices. Which of those groups to trust is another matter entirely.

****

The secondary question is what becomes of Discord as arguably _the_ tool for people organizing work in these spaces? Does Discord get usurped by a superior alternative (of which there aren't many to choose from)? Does Discord try to harness the energy and build to meet the market? Do project organizers learn from their elders embrace email (a man can dream)?

****

Whatever happens, in the near term at least one thing is true: Twitter remains central. The company's head of product marketing has been on this trip for months, and the company's recent rollout of NFT profile photos is the latest deployment from a product giant that's been awakened in the past twelve months.

****

And this brings me to the two projects I am most facinated by at the moment: Bluesky and Mirror.

The former is the working group tasked with bringing forth the open protocol on which Twitter can operate into the future, free to pursue its particular business priorities while operating on a layer free from scrutiny.

WHile the latter appears to be the spiritual successor to Medium (and Blogger before it). The monetization mechanism, however, is baked into the product. You cannot publish to Mirror by virtue of simply having an email address; you must use an Ethereum address. And that same address is programatically addressable, and is able to send and receive the cryptocurrency.

****

And while authors on Mirror _must_ be able to deal in that currency, anyone with a web browser and read what that author publishes. Which, to my eyes, is one of the best counterpoints to the right-click retort from the peanut gallery. Of course the words are free. It is the extent to which they reach people that confers any monetary value. Someone will publish something to Mirror that develops enough cultural currency that the words as an object on the Ethereum blockchain develop monetary value.

****

Each of these publishing tools are therefore ones I'll be watching closely. Both aim to be built on the same type of rails. Rails which are a magnet for charlatans, hucksters, rubes, and fools. But rails nonetheless. Rails that enable all manner of things the internet has never had before.
