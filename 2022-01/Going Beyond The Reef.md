⌬ Going Beyond The Reef ⌬

****

"Computers that make commitments."

That's the first phrase. Uttered by @cdixon on the Bankless podcast (http://podcast.banklesshq.com/47-the-fourth-crypto-cycle-chris-dixon-a16z).

When I heard him explain blockchains this way back in January was when my curiosity piqued.

****

The second was in December, when I read  @aaronlammer in conversation with @cwarzel (https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/galaxy-brain/619717362e822d00205ab3e9/case-for-crypto/). Lammer did an exceptional job of pointing out a fundamental truism: blockchain today is as strange as the internet itself was to the average bear in the 80s and 90s.

****

So naturally when @FoldableHuman's Line Goes Up essay (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g) came across my radar, I gave it my full attention. Olson has produced something that anyone even remotely interested in these ideas should give time to.

****

As the title implies, Olson is far closer to the "useful for enabling new forms of horrific behavior" edge of the spectrum than the "mechanism for technological nirvana" opposite one can very easily find today.

[^My writing here is in part an exercise in finding out.]

****

Broadly speaking though, I'm optimistic. Because we've taught computers to do something they couldn't do before.

How long it will take to get from this place to somewhere useful is unknown.

****

It will take some time before things stop looking like Bill trying to replace Dave's radio (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gipL_CEw-fk). But a fundamental aspect of computing has changed, and I believe it represents a change to the ecology of cyberspace. And when an ecology changes, shit gets wild.

****

The smartphone was the last time we saw ecological change like this. Those devices have become the dominant computing tool, and the changes have proven to be both broad and deep.

And not only that, like with ecologies in the traditional sense, change begets more change.

****

The changes to how people create and express their identities online are, for example, fascinating.

[^Why people selling each other JPEGs has proven to be the most popular application of identity is a topic for another time.]

****

As an outsized aspect of my identity is to share my thinking in writing, @viamirror has been of recent interest.

An early contender for the Blogspot prize, the crew at Mirror are building self-publishing tools on top of Ethereum.

****

Blogger was the wild new thing when I was repairing iMacs at the Stanford Mall in 2005. The most successful writers of the day, blessed by publishing houses and media outlets, and showed very little interest in such a toy.

****

But the people of that era who experimented with the toy, they produced ideas of substance, created names for themselves, and in some cases, built tools which have stood the test of time.

****

Yet the relationships developed between those writers and their audiences, has at best an ephemeral sense of provenance, to say nothing of patronage, or distribution.

****

It's telling that, nearly twenty years after Blogger, one of the most powerful concepts in desktop publishing is users having new content delivered via email for a fee.

****

Since Blogger and before it, composing something and sharing it online has largely been an act of donation. Cyberspace lacks the means for creative expression to accrue any value beyond the memetic.

****

Today however, the primitives exist to bring forth a world where a person can produce something and put online, and its value can be represented in a way that machines, and by extension the people who use them, can intrinsically understand.

****

There are naturally reasons to be concerned. It wouldn't be a new frontier if there weren't charlatans, storms, and dragons. But to bury one's head in the sand, or discount anyone who hasn't already decided to do the same, is no way to live.

****

Go find anyone over the age of sixty and ask them what the popular opinion of personal computing was in 1975. To have believed that we'd all be living as we do today would've had you labelled a lunatic.

****

While replacing our phones with glasses sounds interesting, it's the applications of what Satoshi outlined which will enable the truly bizarre and fascinating futures.

For example, what is fashion in a world where one's appearance is the product of code as opposed to textiles?
