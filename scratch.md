Which brings us to how, I believe, most blockchain applications, like BTC or ETH, have been painted with the bad-for-the-planet brush. In order for those computers to compute, a significant amount of electricity is consumed. That we are living through a moment of reckoning as a species in terms of how we produce electricity and the effect that has on this planet is no laughing matter. And so the advent of what appears to be a superfulous daliance does create something of an easy target for criticism. I'm not going to ignore this aspect of things; I'm simply setting it aside for the moment.

Another idea worth setting aside is the instantiating application of blockchain technology. While some would argue that the Bitcoin white paper is this century's Magna Carta, it is naive to dismiss such an argument because one doesn't believe the world needs a different store of value or medium of exchange. Leave out that the desire to transact without the involvement of a third party is older than the goddamned British Empire. No, it's enough to point out that everything being built today; everything you've heard about; all of it is no more than $TK_YEARS_SINCE_SATOSHI years old.

That publishing essays like this one can produce new shapes is only one aspect of this one star system. There are other forms of creative expression to explore: musicians and poets and visual artists. There are ideas around state and organizational identity. And around careers and skills development. And pseyduonyimty. And more still beyond me at this moment.

To really internalize this dynamic, I find thinking about ecologies like galaxy metaphor feels appropriate: There are numerous star systems to explore, only some of which we're aware of thus far. Who knows how many planets each system consists of, and what each of those contains?

In adjacent systems are DAOs and DeFi. NFTs and Bitcoin. And dark money and [^A favorite dystopian example here is Gary Shtyngart's Super Sad True Love Story.]

Which is how I've arrived here with you, dear reader. My life's circumstances are such that I'm now more motivated to explore than to not. I haven't felt a stronger urge to bring my authentic self out to play in some time. There have been prior attempts to uncover my 'beat' as it were, but very little which has truly excited me; end of the S-curve and all that I suppose. While reaching the point where smartphones are replaced with glasses sounds exciting, it's the applications of blockchain technology which will enable the most interesting scenarios in that environment. For starters, what is fashion in a world where one's appearance is the product of software code as opposed to textiles?

Two of my favorite thinkers of the last century were Hunter Thompson and John Perry Barlow. They were each exceedingly, unabashedly, their own characters. My hope is that I can channel a bit of their energy as I explore the stars. Consider this essay the first in a collection. Dispatches from the field. Situation reports. Letters home.

If you're at all interested, I do hope you'll let me know.

Adam McCay, filmmaker and the father of Pearl the toddler landlord, named his production company Hyperoject. The term is used to describe, say, a paper coffee cup, but rather all paper coffee cups throughout time. [^Still think travel cups are too much of a hassle?] One of the thought technologies I've found to be quite helpful in understanding blockchain era is that any every chain is a hyperobject. Without all the combined computation there is no experience; the collected action of all a chain's users is what alows it to exist. The activity is the computer. [^Scott McNeely strikes again!]
